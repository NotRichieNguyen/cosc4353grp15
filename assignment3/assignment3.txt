2. For the backend, we are using Express.js, a framework that streamlines the management
of requests and responses. It allows for the use of middleware functions to perform
various tasks, including authentication, logging, and error handling. Additionally,
Express.js features a straightforward and user-friendly routing system, enabling us
to define routes for handling different types of HTTP requests effectively.

3. Richie set up the back end for the login and registration system. Danny developed
logic to display each volunteer's history and send notifcations to users. Wilson 
created the event management back end along with the volunteer matching system. Lastly,
Vincent allowed users to manage their profile details including skills and availability.
